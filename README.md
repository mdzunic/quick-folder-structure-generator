# quick-folder-structure-generator
Bash script to quickly generate multiple files and folders with same name, and predefined, filled content.

It currently uses vue,typescript and scss file structure to generate:
* $given_name.vue
* $given_name.ts
* $given_name.scss
* $given_name.spec.ts
* index.ts

Auto filling the content in files is still in progress.
